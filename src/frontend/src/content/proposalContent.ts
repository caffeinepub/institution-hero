  subtitle: 'Heroes and Villains in Higher Education: Resilience and The Role of Next Generation Student Leaders',

  bio: `Crossing borders and building bridges, Michael is a Ph.D. International Psychology student. By earning a B.A. in Psychology and M.A. in Forensic Psychology from The Chicago School, he strengthened his intellectual foundation and presented his work at American Psychological Association conferences. Study-abroad experiences in Berlin, Zurich, and Johannesburg continue to inspire him to expand his mentor's work in resilience, culture, and ethical leadership.`,

  abstractShort: `Academic institutions often reflect stories of "Heroes" and "Villains" in leadership, whether it be student or faculty, the stories reveal how integrity, compassion, and discouraging behaviors shape the climate of higher education. A psychological examination of these contrasting patterns shows that resilience functions as an interwoven process supporting both personal and institutional well-being. Drawing on research on wisdom and knowledge, we highlight how cognitive strengths, identity reconstruction, and social belonging contribute to academic resilience and help prevent dislocation during times of disruption. The session illustrates how ethical and wise leadership modeled through cinematic mentors such as Yoda and Morpheus creates environments where students regain purpose and coherence amid uncertainty. We then focus on next-generation student leaders, demonstrating how they can cultivate resilience as relational wisdom grounded in creativity, curiosity, judgment, and reflective practice. Practical strategies will be offered to help emerging and current leaders foster psychosocial inclusion and strengthen compassionate, ethically responsible cultures within higher education.`,

  abstract: `Every academic institution has its stories of Heroes and Villains in academic leadership that unfold quietly in classrooms, offices, and leadership meetings. The Hero and Villain narrative reveals how resilience, compassion, and integrity shape or sabotage the moral climate of higher education. Exploring the paradox of academic leadership through a psychological lens and building on the virtue of wisdom and knowledge, we will place resilience not merely as endurance but as an attuned process. A dynamic balance between cognitive strengths, identity reconstruction, and social belonging forms the foundation of strong academic resilience. In academic realms, wisdom manifests creative ethical leadership, helping to change psychosocial disruption into opportunities for thriving social capital, development, meaning making, and evolution. Psychosocial inclusion, resilience, and adaptive capacity are foundational elements of identity and mental health. When the fundamentals of leadership collapse, dislocation often comes next; fortunately, protective forces, including social support, mentorship, and moral reflection realign responsibilities, creating equilibrium and redefining the culture of responsibility (McGrath, Erickson, & Mayes, 2022). Much like cinematic mentors who exemplify wisdom, Yoda or Morpheus, heroic academic leaders must foster places where students rediscover purpose and coherence amid institutional uncertainty. Practical intelligence reflects the protective power of wisdom, integrating self, others, and community to rebuild cohesion where exclusion once fractured it. Next-generation student leaders must embody these virtues: cultivating resilience as relational wisdom, guided by creativity, curiosity, judgment, and love of learning, to reweave disrupted academic and psychosocial identities into stronger, more compassionate systems of belonging.`,

  learningOutcomes: [
    'Make a distinction between constructive (heroic) and destructive (villainous) leadership behaviors in higher education, applying ethical and psychological frameworks of resilience and moral integrity, e.g., psychosocial inclusion, identity coherence, and adaptive capacity, reducing dislocation during periods of disruption (McGrath et al., 2022).',
    'Elucidate how wisdom, compassion, and adaptive capacity transform psychosocial disruption into opportunities for belonging and growth.',
    'Demonstrate how next-generation student leaders can cultivate relational resilience and leadership identity through creative, reflective, and inclusive practice.',
