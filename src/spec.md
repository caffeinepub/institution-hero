# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Activity 1 (Your Leadership Word) copy for the examples list, add an anonymity notice, and adjust the submit button label.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Activity 1 “Examples:” list to exactly: ethical, visionary, authentic, resilient, empathetic, principled, transformational, courageous, accountable, inclusive, decisive, adaptable, humble, inspiring, grounded (sourced from the Activity 1 content so it isn’t duplicated).
- Add the anonymous-information notice text to the Activity 1 page: "Your information is anonymous the only information we see is what is on the top leadership word community patterns board".
- Change the Activity 1 submit button label (when not submitting/loading) to: "Share Your leadership word For Feedback" while keeping the submitting state label as "Submitting...".

**User-visible outcome:** On Activity 1, users see the updated examples list, a visible anonymity notice near the community patterns context, and the updated submit button label before submission.
