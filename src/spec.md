# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the References page with the updated 18-item reference list and ensure Activity 1 and Activity 2 citations stay aligned to that same updated list.

**Planned changes:**
- Fully replace the References page “source of truth” and rendered content to exactly match the uploaded updated reference list (same order, formatting, punctuation/diacritics, bracketed notes, and full URLs).
- Update Activity 2 validation citation selection to pull from the updated References list without relying on hard-coded numeric indices, so reordering does not break or mismatch citations.
- Update Activity 1 affirmation messaging so any in-text citations used are present in (and consistent with) the updated References list.

**User-visible outcome:** The References page shows the updated 18 references exactly as provided, and Activity 1/2 display citations that always match entries from that updated References list.
