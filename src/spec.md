# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a new decorative moat-and-trees footer graphic and display it as a bottom strip on all tab/routed pages.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new static footer banner image (moat + trees) that matches the existing castle hero banner illustration style and works well when responsively cropped.
- Add the new footer graphic as a full-width bottom-of-page visual element on all routed/tab pages, positioned above the existing global footer without overlapping page content.

**User-visible outcome:** Every tab page shows a castle-style moat-and-trees decorative strip at the bottom of the page content area, just above the global footer.
