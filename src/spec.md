# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update the Bio page’s “International Experience” section to reflect the new title and present the locations as a formatted list.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the Bio page section header from “International Experience” to “International Educational Experience”.
- Replace the existing descriptive paragraph under that header with a list containing exactly these six locations in order: Berlin, Germany; Zurich, Switzerland; Milan, Italy; London, England; Johannesburg, South Africa; Antigua, Guatemala.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Bio page, users see the updated “International Educational Experience” section with the locations displayed as a clear list, with all other Bio content unchanged.
