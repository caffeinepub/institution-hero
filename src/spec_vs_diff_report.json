However, some requirements cannot be verified from the provided diff (notably Session Outline/Takeaways pages), and Activity 2 submissions are not attributed to the caller Principal in the backend.",

      "requirement": "Associate saved submissions with the authenticated user’s Principal for Activities 1 and 2.",
