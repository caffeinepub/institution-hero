  "summary": "REQ-3 appears implemented via a new /leadership-board route, a new LeadershipBoardPage with the required 2-column layout/headings, and a new \"Leadership Board\" nav link. REQ-1 appears implemented by generating Activity 2 validation using only heroic/protective/micro-solution fields and by storing only those fields for validation. REQ-2 is clearly implemented for Activity 1 (blocks affirmation generation with an English error containing code \"000\"); Activity 2’s blocking/error text is not fully verifiable due to truncation of the relevant section.",

      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Activity 2: When the user requests validation (or generate another), if the input is determined to be Villainous/negative, the UI shows an error containing \"000\" and does not display a validation result.",
      "reason": "The Activity2ResilientLeadershipPage.tsx diff is truncated right after the villainous-input check begins, so the presence of the required user-facing error text including literal code \"000\" and the explicit prevention/clearing of any displayed validation result cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary.",
