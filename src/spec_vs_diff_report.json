  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented via React Query polling/refetch on the Leadership Board and an optimistic cache update for leadership word counts after Activity 1 submission. REQ-3 (optimistic cache update for the micro-solutions list after Activity 2 submission) cannot be confirmed from the provided diff summary because the relevant mutation hook implementation is truncated before any cache update/invalidation logic is shown.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "After a successful Activity 2 submission, update the cached Community Solutions list immediately so any mounted Leadership Board/solutions views reflect the new micro-solution right away (in the same SPA session), without waiting for the next refetch.",
      "reason": "The diff shows polling support for fetching micro-solutions, but the Activity 2 submit mutation (useSubmitResilientLeadershipActivity) is truncated before any onSuccess handler that would setQueryData for ['microSolutions'] (and preserve invalidation) is visible. Therefore the immediate cached update behavior is not evidenced.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts (truncated, useSubmitResilientLeadershipActivity shown without onSuccess cache update)",
        "frontend/src/components/MicroSolutionsCommunityList.tsx (polling added but not an immediate cache insert on submit)"
